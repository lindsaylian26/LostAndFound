# Welcome to the LostandFound testing file.

# The purpose of testing this project is to try to attack and fix as many potential bugs as possible before rollout.

# WHAT YOU NEED TO TEST:

# * Please create at least one test for all functionalities that a user can do. 
# * ** This includes things like posting and being able to click on items to view them. 
# * Make tests ensuring that the expected outcome occurs whenever its requirements are met, and also for when they are not met
# * ** This includes things like having the appropriate error message come up when invalid/insufficient information is uploaded
# * It's only necessary to write one test for each scenario, but all scenarios must be accounted for.
# * ** For example, if a function needs 4 different fields to be filled out in order to be valid, 2 are strings, and 2 are ints, only 3 tests need to be made.
# * ** *** One test for a valid input, one test for an invalid/empty int input, and one test for an invalid/empty string input. 

# IMPORTANT: You must include the keyword 'test' at the beginning of each test you write. 
# For example, creating a test called 'createUser_test' will NOT run, but a test called 'test_createUser' would run.
