  <h1>Lost and Found</h1>
  <p>This site is a University-centered Lost and Found app. </p>
  <p>We created this site during the Spring of 2024 in CS 3240 at the University of Virginia.</p>
</div>

<div class="explainer">
  <h2>Why a Lost and Found Site</h2>
  <p>Currently, there exists no mainstream, organized way of reporting lost or found items at the University. 
      Students use a variety of means to report their items such as a GroupMe thread, or class Snapchat stories. 
      The GroupMe, though, contains a limited number of students, and you must be manually added to the group to submit an item as lost or found.
      The Snapchat story is effective in getting your report to see a large number of people, but reports disappear after 24 hours.</p>
  <p>We saw an issue with this, and came up with a solution. </p>
</div>

<div class="explainer">
  <h2>About Lost and Found</h2>
  <p>Our site facilitates anonymous users and users with an account, or common users. 
    Anonymous users can submit a report of a found item, and common users can submit a report for lost or found items.
    Since reporting a lost item will require a follow-up from admin, we restrict lost item reports to only users with accounts.
  </p>
  <p>Once a report is submitted, a common user can view their own post history, or view a feed of lost or found items.
      Site administrators can view reports and approve them with the option to submit text explanation for the resolution.
      This approval will be visible for common users, and can help them locate their lost items, or let them know that a found item has been retrieved by its owner. 
  </p>
  <p>There is also an option for common users to mark a post they see as "flagged." 
      A post should be flagged if it is a duplicate post, or contains sensitive information or illegal contents.
      Once a post has been marked as flagged, admin will review the post and resolve as necessary.
  </p>
  <p>The intention of this app is to provide a safe, effective way of returning lost items to their owner. 
      Since this is a class project, please do not submit any real information. 
  </p>

  <h2>How To Use Lost and Found</h2>
  <h3>Anonymous Users:</h3>
  <p> As an anonymous user, you can submit an item as "found". 
    To do so, simply navigate to the "Report Found Item" page, and fill out the form with information regarding the item you found.
    None of your personal information will be recorded or shared with anyone.
    From there, our site administrators will do their best to ensure that the found item is returned to its owner. 
    Thank you for your help!
  </p>
  <p> If you would like to create an account, please navigate to the "Login or Sign Up" page.
    There, you can either log in via Google login or through the site login. 
    If you don't have an account, you can create an account through the "Create an account" page.</p>
  <h3>With an Account:</h3>
  <p> As a user with an account, you have some additional features available. </p>
  <p> You have the ability to submit reports for both items that you found, as well as your own items that you have lost. 
    Under the "Report" tab, you can navigate to the respective reporting pages for lost and found items, and fill out the form for your lost or found item.
  <p> As a common user, you also have the option to browse lost and found items in your community. 
    That way, you can determine if any found items belong to yourself or someone you may know, or determine if you may have located any lost items.
    From each feed page, you can click on 'view more details' to see all of the information about an item.
    You may also wish to flag a post if you deem it to be inappropriate, a duplicate or spam. 
    This will remove the item from the feed and send it to a site administrator for review.  </p>
    You also have the option to view your own post history to check the status of your submissions. 
    If an item is 'Under Review', it has been viewed by a site administrator. In constrast, if it is 'Submitted', your item has not been.
     If a post is 'Approved', it means the submission has been reviewed and approved to be visible on the feed by an administrator, and you may receive a text explanation of this resolution on your Post History page.
     You have the option to delete your own post, and in addtion, a site administrator has the option to remove your post from the feed. 
     Once removed, your post will still be visible on your submission history page, and you have the option to permanently delete your post or appeal the post's rejection.
